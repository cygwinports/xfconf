xfconf
------------------------------------------
Xfconf is the new configuration system for Xfce 4.6, replacing the old 
MCS system that had been present since 4.0.0.

Xfconf is intended to be more general-purpose than MCS ever was, and 
not even require a GUI for management of settings. Some may consider 
Xfconf's architecture to be similar to that of gconf, and they wouldn't 
be completely wrong. However, Xfconf is designed to be much simpler and 
easier to work with, while still being much more flexible than MCS and 
providing core Xfce applications and 3rd-party applications an 
easy-to-use configuration system.
